**Time to reflect on last week's sprint! Consider the progress we made last week, the organization and communication between teams, the division of tasks, and think about how you showed up. Now, let's discuss the follwoing questions.**

## What went well?

---

- having set meeting times!!! very helpful for accountability and organization
- a lot more organization with Github issues and the Kanban project board
- getting momentum on the project

## What weighed us down?

---

- not everyone has an issue; we need more people to pick up issues
- for some tasks: unsure how to make edits without conflicting with other people's code/ their task
- incremental build-up nature of tasks
- unclear descriptions for some of the Github issues

## What challenges are coming up?

---

- 2 weeks left to complete the project: short time frame
- midterms and last labs for this class, work for other classes
- Teoman: stuck on Prettier and ESLint refinements

## What can we do to address them?

---

- hold people accountable for their work with regular standups, to ensure we are on track to completing the MVP
- Clarify Github issue descriptions
- manage your time wisely and communicate if you are stuck on a task/ can't finish something in time

## Once around the table

End on a positive note by sharing things we're looking forward to!
