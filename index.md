## Architectural Decision Making Records

1. [5/11/25: Jest for testing, JSDocs for documentation](https://cse110-22-trojanhorses.github.io/cse110-sp25-group22/051125-Jest-JSdocs.md)
2. [5/18/25: Code style enforcement with ESLint and Prettier](https://cse110-22-trojanhorses.github.io/cse110-sp25-group22/051825-editor-quality-enforcers)

## **Our Mission and Values**

---

We value **creativity and innovation**, and our team is dedicated to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to learn and enjoy this project, regardless of their background.

### Motivation

Our team number, 22, is the number for Titanium on the periodic table! Following this line of thinking, we mapped Titanium to Titans to Ancient Greece, to the horse gif that we decided we wanted as our mascot, and settled on Trojan Horses! As our title suggests, we hope to put focus on craft and strategy in our development practice, intentionally selecting each feature and design choice we make.

### Mantra

1. Build with intentionality
2. No member left behind! We move as fast as the slowest person
3. Teamwork makes the dreamwork
4. Don't be afraid to rip up the blueprints

### Expectations

---

1. Communicate absences from classes or meetings at least 2 hours in advance
2. Check the slack daily!
3. Keep track of your tasks and respond to teammates in a timely manner (within 48 hours)
4. Ask for help when you need it! Do not be afraid that you don't know enough - we're in this together
5. Have fun!
